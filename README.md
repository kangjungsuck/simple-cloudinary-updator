# very simple cloudinary uploader

## usage

- put images or folders with images into `./myImages`
- it is ok to make nested folders. just like normal folder with images...
- make sure set `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_SECRET` and `FOLDER_NAME`(in cloudinary. where files go) in `.env`.
- then run

```
node upload.js
```
